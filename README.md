Weather Dashboard. Prepare for the weather.

# Description

The Weather-Dashboard application gives users access to a weather database upon searching a desired city. The application displays the current weather and five day forecast. Within the current weather, the application displays the city name, weather icon, current date, current temperature, the high temp of the day, the low temp of the day, wind speed and the UV index (with color coding to match UV index value). In the five day forecast, each subsequent day displays in dynamically created cards. Each card contains the date, max temperature, humidity and weather icon. The weather-dashboard also stores the cities searched to local storage. Every city searched generates a dynamically created button with the city name. The user can click on any button with a city name and the application with display both current weather and five day forecast for that city.

This application is powered by HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, and JQUERY. All weather information is obtained through the OpenWeather API via AJAX calls within JavaScript. The Weather-Dashboard is also fully mobile responsive.
